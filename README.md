# CSC405-Group2

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 datasets which focus on confirmed cases, deaths, and county populations. This project also uses enrichment data of political leanings, social characteristics, employment, and census data of particular counties to see the patterns that emerge from these characteristics.

The project will also include several more stages that will build upon the previous ones. The project will incorporate data modeling, basic machine learning, and an interactive dashboard. All of this will allow for further analysis of the COVID-19 disease spread and the effect of it on a county level.

### Stage I

The first stage of the project involves becoming familiar with the main COVID-19 dataset and the enrichment datasets being used in this project. It will also incorporate initial merges and hypothesis questions.
